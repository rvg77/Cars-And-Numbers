# Cars-And-Numbers

It is a fun project. One day I decided to understand how the car numbers recognition works.
First of all, I figured out the solution of Instance segmentation task using the popular network architecture Mask R-CNN.
And then, I found the [nomeroff-net](https://github.com/ria-com/nomeroff-net) and applyed it to detect the car number.
